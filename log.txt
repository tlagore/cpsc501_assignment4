    fixed makefile to properly compile gprof on frequency convolve.c

    Ive mostly given up on trying to be able to get the frequency domain convolution to work. Need to finish profiling, refactoring, and writeups and there isnt enough time. The frequency domain convolution SHOULD be taking as much time as it would be taking if it was producing proper output, so I will profile on it regardless.

    implemented fft. Appears to be working, but how would i know!? Still need to divide samples by N, perform multiplication, and send the data back through the inverse fft.

    Added file structure for time_domain version and frequency_domain version of the project. Moved shared files to a shared directory and updated the makefile to handle the new directory tree. Refactored some generic array functionality into a new c file, utils

    removed a wav file from git repo

    Found bugs in write to wav file. Wasnt writing properly in little endian. Also found bugs with writing file. Was allocated half the necessary space for the float array, fixed these issues.  Also added a normalization function that ensures all float values from the convolution are between -1.0 and 1.0 which has eliminated most of the static coming from the produced wave files. Some wave files produce a little bit of static, this could be due to the quality of the original wav file, or the normaliz method might not be aggressive enough.

    fixed bug with reading a header from a wav file where the header size was *not* 44 bytes. Should now account for extra parameters based on the chunk side found within the header.

    found a bug when converting int array to float array. documentation would suggest that float and int take up the same amount memory, practice would disagree.

    changed wav_data, ir_data, and output data arrays to float* instead of char*. Added convolve function which follows the alogrithm from class. Have not yet tested.

    fixed bug where output buffer could not be allocated. Was using int instead of unsigned int and was probably passing a negative value to malloc. Also added typedefs.h which specifies various define macros for types, such as TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0

    added a new function char* getWaveData(FILE *fp, int data_size) which takes in a file point and attempts to read data_size bytes from the wav file and return the data as a char*

    Added a function to read in the header data of the input wav file and the impulse response wav file. The first 44 bytes of the file are copied into a header struct to hold the information. Also added a new function displayHeaderInfo(stuct WavHeader) which displays the contents of the header to screen. Wrote 2 helper functions to achieve this, displayArray(char*,int size) and displayArrayHeaderfield(char* arr, int size, char* fieldName)

    edited gitignore to ignore bin files, but not the directory itself (useful if someone else pulse and tries to make, so bin directory exists)

    added wav_files to project directory and created gitignore to ignore them as well as source files. Restructured directory to have a src and bin directory. makefile now makes from src and stores executable in bin.
